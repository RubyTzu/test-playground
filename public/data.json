I used these tools to complete this amazing exhibition design journey: Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Unity2D.\n\nThrough team collaboration, we produced all the interactive elements in just six months. The process began with designing on the computer, and after extensive discussions with the client, we moved to the exhibit site to continue our work. Transforming the exhibit from raw materials to a lively interactive project was truly a magnificent experience.",

This immersive interactive experience will help you better understand the relationship between coral and humans, allowing you to explore all the marvelous details and refresh your knowledge about them.",

I completed it using the Next.js framework, CSS tools like Tailwind CSS, and animation tools like Motion (formerly known as Framer Motion). I also used Git for team collaboration and integrated APIs by simulating with json-server and connecting to actual APIs with the help of tools like Apidog. The creation of the calculator is thanks to Stack Overflow users and the countless issues I was able to resolve with help from the platform.",
