I used these tools to complete this amazing exhibition design journey: Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Unity2D.\n\nThrough team collaboration, we produced all the interactive elements in just six months. The process began with designing on the computer, and after extensive discussions with the client, we moved to the exhibit site to continue our work. Transforming the exhibit from raw materials to a lively interactive project was truly a magnificent experience.",

This immersive interactive experience will help you better understand the relationship between coral and humans, allowing you to explore all the marvelous details and refresh your knowledge about them.",
