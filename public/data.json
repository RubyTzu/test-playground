Whether it's discussing slight animations for the user interface or how the APIs should be handed off, we spend a significant amount of time ensuring everything works as smoothly and precisely as it should. I completed it using the Next.js framework, CSS tools like Tailwind CSS, and animation tools like Motion (formerly known as Framer Motion). I also used Git for team collaboration and integrated APIs by simulating with json-server and connecting to actual APIs with the help of tools like Apidog. The creation of the calculator is thanks to Stack Overflow users and the countless issues I was able to resolve with help from the platform.",

I collaborated with an excellent UI/UX designer and a dedicated backend developer.
